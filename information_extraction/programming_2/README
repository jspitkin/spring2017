=== Running My Code ===

My program is written in Python 3. To run my code on a CADE machine move into the directory with dirt.py and run 

'python3 dirt.py <corpus_file> <test_file> <minfreq>'

I have included a shell script 'run.sh' which will run the provided example. Also 'example.trace' is a trace of it's output.

=== CADE Machine ===

I developed and tested my code on CADE machine lab1-19. To my knowledge, there are no known limitations or bugs.

Thanks!
