Integer programming - general language to express the restrictions of inference. Search over a discrete set.
Allows injection of "knowledge" into the inference in the form of constraints.
NP hard in general to solve.
Give it to commerical solvers such as Gurobi.
Can approximate to linear programs and hope for the best.

Linear programming - minimizing a linear objective function subject to a finite number of linear constraints (equality or inequality).
